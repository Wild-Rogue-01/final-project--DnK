## Project title and description

For our final project, we have recreated Conway's game of life in MakeCode Arcade. This game was created by a British computer scientist named John Horton Conway in 1970, as a simulation of life at its most basic form. This kind of simulation, an automaton, describes the process in which cells interact and multiply.


## Collaborator (if you are working with another teammate)
Kiran and Dashel worked together to create this game. 




## Instructions to run the project

To run the project, first use the cursor (controled with the four arrow keys) to select tiles. By clicking the space bar (or the 'A' button on screen), you can turn the white tiles to black tiles (black tiles represent alive cells). To start the game, press enter on your keyboard (or 'B' on screen) to toggle the simulation.




## Reflection on what you learned

This project helped us learn how to collaborate on Github, through pull requests, creating branches, and merges. We also learned more about tile maps and button configuration (which were critical in our program as we had multiple functions mapped to the same keys/buttons).
